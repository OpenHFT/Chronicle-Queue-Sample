== Downloading and running sample programs

If you're running Windows, you will need to install the `git` client and `open-ssh` Cygwin, https://cygwin.com/install.html[here],
with a guide showing installation and packages http://www.mcclean-cooper.com/valentino/cygwin_install/[here].
This allows you to install Linux packages that aren't already on Windows.

When this asks you which packages you want to install, search for and add `git`. This is under `Development` and you need to click `skip` so it says to `install`.

Ensure you have the JDK for Java 8, you could use http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html[this].

Open Intelij or your https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment[IDE], or https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/#section=windows[install Intelij] first if you haven't already.
Intelij is used for this tutorial.

Go to `Check out from Version Control` and select `Git`, opening the `Clone Repository`.
This is where you will get a copy of the Chronicle Queue Demo code.
